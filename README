Quick guide to PermonQP installation:

1. set environment variables PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH pointing to a PETSc instance
   - PETSC_ARCH may is empty in case of "prefix" PETSc installation
   - for more details about PETSc installation and the two environment variables, see PETSc documentation
2. set PERMON_DIR variable pointing to the PermonQP directory (probably this file's parent directory)
3. build PermonQP simply using makefile (makes use of PETSc buildsystem)
     make
4. if the build is successful, there is a new subdirectory named $PETSC_ARCH, the program library is $PETSC_ARCH/lib/libpermon.{so,a}
   - shared library (.so) is built just if PETSc has been configured with option --with-shared-libraries
   - all compiler settings are inherited from PETSc
